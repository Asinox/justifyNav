jquery.justifyNav.js
====================

Have you ever wanted horizontal navigation made up of list items in HTML, that are equally-spaced and line up with the left and right edges of their container? Did you do it in CSS? After much Googling, I couldn't find a way to do this in CSS. So, I wrote a JQuery plug-in. The code is licensed under the MIT license, so you can use it for commercial purposes.

See example.html for an example of how to use the script. And, see [my blog article](http://www.highintegritydesign.com/blog/articles/equally-spaced-horizontal-navigation-links-jquery-script) for a complete tutorial on how the script works. If you do find a way to accomplish this in CSS, please let me know!
